              As secretary of PSI Alpha, I manage the attendance of members, 
              and work with the other officers to give members opportunities to explore 
              and expand their knowledge of psychology. </p>
          <p>Member of Mu Alpha Theta:
            As a part of Mu Alpha Theta, I tutor kids who are
            struggling with any level of maths. </p>
          <p>Member of Science National Honor Society:
              I have taken many challenging science courses
              and really love Chemistry and Physics.
              Therefore, I joined SNHS to explore different interesting
              topics related to science.</p>
          <p>Member of National Technical Honor Society:
              NTHS is an organization for students who have
              a keen interest in the technical field.I plan
              on pursuing Computer Science and joined NTHS
              to meet with others who have similar interests
              and work on CS related projects.</p>
          <p>DECA:
              DECA also known as Distributive Education Clubs of America
              is a club I have been a part of for approximately 1 year.
              As a part of this club, I work with other group members in this club to create a
              product that is 10-15 pages to present. This club has helped me improve my
              communication skills and get a good work ethic.</p>
          <p>Math UIL:
              I joined Math UIL because of my interest of mathematics.
              As a part of Math UIL, I participate in competitions which
              test our skills related to different aspects of Math. I mostly
              participate in number sense (requires mental math) and calculator apps.
              Last school year, I was very close to advancing to regionals for Calculator apps.
              I am participating in Math UIL again this year, and am aiming to make
              it to regionals this year. </p>

          <p>Volunteering:
            I have approximately 50 volunteering hours which I have gathered by working 2 hours per week for 25 weeks.
